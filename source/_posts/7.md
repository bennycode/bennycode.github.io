Importing a function in ES6 can look like this:

```js
import {getIndexValue} from './math/FibonacciSequence';
```

- problems with tsc
- you need a config (think of webpack zero config trend)
- it is not clear if node modules or not (think of lodash/...)
- adds a layer of complexity
- IDE loss of auto import (needs to be adjusted)
- IDE loss of jump into that file
- IDE can change paths anyway
- it adds convenience which is given by the IDE already
- Turn "util" often becomes "utils" because of clash with node core library
