In my case TypeScript did not know about `window.__coverage__` which is a property that is set by istanbul's instrumenter class.

When trying to use if TypeScript will complain:

> TS2339: Property '__coverage__' does not exist on type 'Window'.

To get along with it we need to make TypeScript aware of this new property by declaring it in our TypeScript code:

```ts
declare global {
  interface Window {
    __coverage__: Object;
  }
}
```
